# Written by: Balmes Pavlov
# 3/28/17 Edit: Updated for 10.12.4 compatibility. Added an additional exit codes and modified script to take into account which startosinstall command
# to use as Apple has modified the options in 10.12.4. Also added functions to reduce code re-use.
#
# 9/26/17 Edit: Updated for 10.13 compatibility. Cleaned up additional code logic. Added FV2 authenticated restart.
#
# 2/27/19 Edit: Updated for 10.14 compatibility. Added support for additional packages. Added better logging of startosinstall failures by logging to /var/log/installmacos_<timestamp>.log. Removed iCloud checking.
#
# 3/27/19 Edit: Redirected some output that would appear in stdout. Resolved CoreStorage conversion detection. Made it explicit what user account is being asked for FV authentication.
#
# 10/28/19 Edit: Updated for 10.15 compatibility. Fixed an issue where variables were not being recalculated. Compartmentalized script further into functions. Reduced duplicate code where possible.
#               Added a few new features:
#               Function to quit all active apps (based on code from @dwshore: https://github.com/bp88/JSS-Scripts/pull/4#issue-301247270)
#               Function to check for expired certificates in the macOS installer app
#               Reduced the number of Jamf parameters required by capturing information from the macOS installer itself
#               Cleaned up documentation
# 10/2/20 Edit: Updated for macOS 11 compatibility. Due to some issues, I had to comment out the quit all active apps function and code.
#               macOS 11 installer has changed enough that checking for expired certificates is not feasible like it was with prior installers.
#
# This script is meant to be used with Jamf Pro.
# It will make sure of the macOS Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, or Catalina installer app along with some JSS script parameters and is intended to be somewhat easy to modify if used with future OS deployments.
# Required: Parameter $4 is used to determine the full macOS installer app path. Enter the full path (e.g. /Users/Shared/Installer macOS Sierra.app)
#
# Required: Parameter $5 is for the time estimate in minutes. Type out the time in minutes.
#
# Optional: Parameter $6 is for the custom trigger name of a policy that should be used to deploy the macOS installer app.
# If you do not fill this in and the macOS installer app has not be installed on the computer, the script will exit and warn the user.
# You can opt to not use this parameter, but just make sure to deploy the macOS installer app through other means if that's the route you choose to take.
#
# Optional: Parameter $7 is used if you want to add an additional install package to install after the OS upgrade completes.
# This is done through the "--installpackage" option which was introduced in the macOS High Sierra installer app.
# Read the following blog for more details on the caveats with this option: https://managingosx.wordpress.com/2017/11/17/customized-high-sierra-install-issues-and-workarounds/
#
# Optional: Parameter $8 is used to determine the minimum macOS installer app version just in case you want a specific version of the installer app on the computer.
# This comes in handy in situations where the computer might have the macOS 10.12.2 installer, but you want the 10.12.3 installer at minimum on the computer.
# Why? Apple may have released a specific feature (e.g. disable iCloud Doc Sync via config profile in 10.12.4+) that is in a newer minor update
# that you want to make use of immediately after computer has been upgraded.
#
# Optional: Parameter $9 is used to provide the contact email, number or name of the IT department for the end user to reach out to should issues arise.
# The phrase will be "Please contact <insert info from parameter 9>"
#
#
# In case you want to examine why the script may have failed, I've provided exit codes.
# Exit Codes
# 1: Missing JSS parameters that are required.
# 2: Minimum required OS value has been provided and the client's OS version is lower.
# 3: Invalid OS version value. Must be in form of 10.12.4
# 4: No power source connected.
# 5: macOS Installer app is missing "InstallESD.dmg" & "startosinstall". Due to 1) bad path has been provided, 2) app is corrupt and missing two big components, or 3) app is not installed.
# 6: macOS Installer app is missing Info.plist
# 7: Invalid value provided for free disk space.
# 8: The minimum OS version required for the macOS installer app version on the client is greater than the macOS installer on the computer.
# 9: The startosinstall exit code was not 0 or 255 which means there has been a failure in the OS upgrade. See log at: /var/log/installmacos_{timestamp}.log and /var/log/install.log and /var/log/system.log
# 11: Insufficient free space on computer.
# 14: Remote users are logged into computer. Not secure when using FV2 Authenticated Restart.
# 16: FV2 Status is either not Encrypted, in progress or something other than Off.
# 17: Logged in user is not on the list of the FileVault enabled users.
# 18: Password mismatch. User may have forgotten their password.
# 19: FileVault error with fdesetup. Authenticated restart unsuccessful.
# 20: Install package to run post-install during OS upgrade does not have a Product ID. Build distribution package using productbuild. More info: https://managingosx.wordpress.com/2017/11/17/customized-high-sierra-install-issues-and-workarounds/
# 21: CoreStorage conversion is in the middle of conversion. Only relevant on non-APFS. See results of: diskutil cs info /
# 22: Failed to unmount InstallESD. InstallESD.dmg may be mounted by the installer when it is launched through the GUI. However if you quit the GUI InstallAssistant, the app fails to unmount InstallESD which can cause problems on later upgrade attempts.
# 23: Expired certificate found in macOS installer app
# 24: Expired certificate found in one of packages inside macOS installer's InstallESD.dmg
# 25: Could not determine plist value. Plistbuddy returned an empty value.
# 26: Could not determine OS version in the app installer's base image.
# 27: Could not determine plist value. Plistbuddy is trying to read from a file that does not exist.
